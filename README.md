# Python Programs I made during my first semester at IISER-K

### A brief idea of what each program does:
1. **GOATED Func Approximator**
   - Graphs any function you want it to
   - Will ask for the limits of the domain of the function
   - Will ask for *frequency*
      * Frequency is a term which is inversely proportional to smoothness of the graphs
      * If the frequency is set to, let's say... 0.1, the program computes the function for x that occur at intervals of 0.1
      *
