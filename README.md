# Python Programs I made during my first semester at IISER-K
---

### A brief idea of what each program does:
1. **GOATED Func Approximator**
   - Graphs any function you want it to (Râ†’R)
   - Will ask for the limits of the domain of the function
   - Will ask for *frequency*
      * Frequency is a term which is inversely proportional to smoothness and accuracy of the graphs
      * If the frequency is set to, let's say... 0.1, the program computes the function for x that occur at intervals of 0.1
   - Will then ask you to input a function, which you'll have to type out in python syntax with or without using the math module
2. **Kaprekar**
   - Outputs Kaprekar constants
   - <a href=https://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/sample.php> Know more about kaprekar contants </a>
3. **Goated Prime checker**
   - Outputs prime numbers between 1 and n where n is a number we input
4. **Golden Spiral**
   - Traces out the golden spiral till the distance and upto the accuracy that we input
5.
